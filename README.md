# Boston-House-Prices

in this model, I tried to find a way to split the data, that was saved in one column and was skewed and had outliers and the length of rows was small so I used the DissicionTree model 





Tools used :



pandas 

Matplotlib

DecisionTreeRegressor

GridSearchCV

mean_squared_error,mean_absolute_error

StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler





It was good work I hope you get the best benefit
